An Arduino board is somewhat similiar to what is aimed to be designed at the end of the course. Breaking its componenets down for better understanding of what it looks like and what is to be designed is what will follow. The Arduino processr contains most essentially, an SOC RISCV chip, pads, and ssome foundary Ips such as ADC,SRAM DSP etc. It also contains Macros such as SPI block etc.

ISA: In layman's terms, ISA or Instruction Set Architecture is simply the language of the computers. The RISCV architecture implements instructions into the CPU core of the computer. The applications use high level languages which is compiled by the complier into instrictions for the computer which is further converted into binary by the assembler which is finally understood by the hardware
