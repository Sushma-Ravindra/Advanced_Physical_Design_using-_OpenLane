  <summary>Talking to Computers</summary>


An Arduino board is somewhat similiar to what is aimed to be designed at the end of the course. Breaking its componenets down for better understanding of what it looks like and what is to be designed is what will follow. The Arduino processr contains most essentially, an SOC RISCV chip, pads, and ssome foundary Ips such as ADC,SRAM DSP etc. It also contains Macros such as SPI block etc.

ISA: In layman's terms, ISA or Instruction Set Architecture is simply the language of the computers. The RISCV architecture implements instructions into the CPU core of the computer. The applications use high level languages which is compiled by the complier into instrictions for the computer which is further converted into binary by the assembler which is finally understood by the hardware

Digital ASIC design using Open Source Tools: 
1) RTL Designs: libcores.org, opencores.org,github.com
2) EDA Tools: Qflow, OpenRoad, OpenLane
3) PDK: Google:Skywater
  
ASIC flow: RTL TO GSDII flow: 
__Synthesis -> Floor and PowerPlan -> Placement -> Clock Tree Synthesis -> Routing -> SignOff (Tapeout)__


Synthesis: RTL to gate level Netlist. 
FloorPLan: Patrition and pinrows ets. Powerpin connections to rails
PLacement: Alignment- Global and Detailed 
CTS: Clock Network design
Routing: Implement Interconnect using metal layers, Global and deayled routing 
GDSII: DRC,LVS,STA and tapeout.


Challenges with Open Source Tools: Configuration, Calibration and some missing tools can be encountered while building an ASIC chip which must be effectively dealt with.

OpenLane and STrive Chipsets

Skywater PDK is used. Openlane provides a large number ofdesign examples and can be used to harden macros and chips. It is containerized and tuned for skywater130nm pdk.


OpenLane ASIC flow: To build clean GDSII with no human interaction. 

The following diagram gives a detailed explanantion of ASIC flow through OpenLane

Below is the simplified flow:

    RTL Design (Register-Transfer Level): At this stage, engineers create a high-level description of the desired chip's functionality using a hardware description language like VHDL or Verilog. This description defines how data moves between registers and logic gates in the chip.

    Synthesis: The RTL code is synthesized into a gate-level representation. This step transforms the high-level description into a netlist of logic gates that can be implemented in silicon. Optimization techniques are applied to improve performance, power consumption, and area usage.

    Floorplanning: Engineers create a layout plan, or floorplan, that specifies where different functional blocks will be placed on the chip. This step considers factors like power distribution and signal routing.

    Placement : The synthesized gates are physically placed on the chip according to the floorplan. This step aims to minimize the physical distance between related gates to improve performance.

    Routing: Wires are connected between the gates to establish the logical connections defined in the RTL code. This step involves complex algorithms to optimize for speed, power, and area.

    Physical Verification : The design is thoroughly checked for issues like timing violations, manufacturing defects, and design rule violations. Tools ensure that the chip will function correctly and be manufacturable.

    Mask Generation: The final layout, or mask, is generated based on the design. This mask provides a blueprint for the semiconductor fabrication process.

    Manufacturing: The mask is used to manufacture the physical semiconductor wafer in a semiconductor fabrication facility (fab). This involves a series of intricate processes, including photolithography, etching, and doping, to create the actual chip.

    Testing: After fabrication, each chip is rigorously tested to identify defects and ensure functionality.

    Packaging: The individual chips are packaged into protective casings that include pins or connectors for interfacing with other electronic components.

    GDS2 Format: GDS2 is a file format used to represent the final chip layout and mask data. It contains information about the physical layout of the chip, including the positions of gates, wires, and other elements.

  <summary>Chip Floorplanning Considerations</summary>


__Utilization Factor and Floorplanning__

Physical processor core is an independent execution unit that can run one program thread at a time in parallel with other cores.

Processor die is a single continuous piece of semiconductor material (usually silicon). A die can contain any number of cores. Up to 15 are available on the Intel product line. Processor die is where the transistors making up the CPU actually reside.

Processor package is what you get when you buy a single processor. It contains one or more dies, plastic/ceramic housing for dies and gold-plated contacts that match those on your motherboard.

Core:
The width of the core typically refers to the physical size or dimensions of the central processing unit (CPU) or processor core within a microchip. It is usually measured in nanometers (nm) or micrometers (Âµm). For example, you might hear about a "14nm core" or a "7nm core," indicating the feature size of the core's transistors.
The height of the core is not commonly referred to in the same way as the width. Instead, the core's size is usually described in terms of its area, which is determined by multiplying its width and height.

Die (also known as the chip or silicon die):
The width of the die is typically the physical measurement of the semiconductor wafer after all the individual ICs (integrated circuits) have been fabricated on it but before they are cut apart. Die widths can vary significantly depending on the specific manufacturing process and the design of the chips being produced. They can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters or more.

Similar to the core, the height of the die is not a common parameter of discussion. Instead, the die's size is often described in terms of its area, which is the product of its width and height.

Utilization factor of 1 means the chip is square chip.


```
  Utilisation Factor =    Area occupied by netlist
                       __________________________
                          Total area of core

  Aspect Ratio =  Height
                 ________
                  Width

```
